# Project Proposal: Board Game recommendation system

## Leading Question
Our project aims to create a system that will use a board game dataset (found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mrpantherson/board-game-data?select=bgg_db_1806.csv)) which will be able to recommend a set of board games for one to play based on parameters that a user inputs, such as how many players they have, what kind of categories they enjoy, and how much time they have to play. Our graph will of course use individual board games as nodes, and it will be connected to other games with the same categories, and they will be connected by weighted edges that represent the similarity in the time to play, as well as the category overlap. The similarity in time to play will be measured by the absolute value of the difference between the average play times of these games. The average play time of each game is listed as a value for each game in our dataset, so we can use that. Therefore, we will weight edges based both on how much the categories overlap and this similarity of times, using some function that combines these two values. It will probably be the weighted sum of 1/number of similar categories (and the case for dividing by 0 should not arise as games that do not have any category overlap should not be connected at all), and the playtime similarity discussed earlier. The weights to combine these values will have to be determined. The overall graph should be  connected, and this will be an important charecteristic given the other questions we aim to answer with the graph. Another question that we can answer using this graph is how similar two board games are. If we imagine a scenario in which two people have different preferences in board games, a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to obtain a path between these games. This path would represent games that our two players can play that are increasingly similar until they are each comfortable playing with each other. We can also answer the question of which board games are the most ubiquitous by using a betweenness centrality algorithm. Finally, our recommendation system will create a set of board games that a player might want to play based on a specific board game they particularly enjoy as well as some other user inputted parameters, which can be achieved using a breadth first search.

## Dataset
Our dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/mrpantherson/board-game-data?select=bgg_db_1806.csv
This dataset contains information about thousands of board games, such as ratings, category tags, minimum and maximum # of players, play time, and more. Given that this dataset is rather large, we may have to limit our study to only the top 500 or so games. The dataset is in the form of a CSV file, but will have to be modified into a graph file format that likely stores a matrix of weighted edges based on a heuristic of our choosing. This will allow us to access nodes in O(1) time, at the tradeoff of an O(n^2) space requirement. We will look through our dataset to see if any egregious errors seem present.

## Graph algorithms
The graph algorithms we will use are a breadth first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for computing the betweeness centrality. The BFS should run in O(V+E) time, Dijkstra's algorithm should run in O(E+VlogV) time, and the Floyd-Warhsall algorithm will run in O(V^3) time in the worst case. Our BFS will be used to produce a set of similar board games given a certain board game and parameters to find a similar one according to parameters such as number of players or play time. Using the standard BFS traversal algorithm with a queue, the BFS will traverse the graph until it finds nodes that are too far from the query based on the input parameters, so for example if the max playtime gets out of the bound of the users input, the traversal should not include that node. Dijkstra's algorithm will produce a set of games that relates any two board games no matter how dissimilar, so that one may break out of their comfort zone to a new board game in an easy manner, by taking a path of increasingly similar games. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm will answer a more general question about our graph, that being which games are the most ubiquitous. This should tell us how each board game relates to others. Hopefully, the edge weights here will tell us both how board games are contained within categories and time intervals, based on how we bias these individual categories in the edge weights.

## Timeline
We will attempt to complete our project in the timeline as follows.

 - By Nov. 19: Have the data processed and a graph API that allows for accessing and modifying data, make sure that it will be able to be traversed, and that group members understand its workings.
 - By Nov. 26: Have a breadth first search algorithm complete.
 - By Dec. 3: Have Dijkstra's algorithm complete.
 - By Dec. 10: Have the Floyd-Warshall algorithm complete.
 - Iron out any final issues by due date of Dec. 13
Our 3 graph algorithms can also be worked on in parallel, so in reality the deadline for all three of these should be December 10th. However we should try to accomplish them in a timely manner, which this timeline should help us accomplish.
