# Report 11-22

After our proposal was approved, we began to work on our project. Prior to this, we had achieved only minimal progress with our codebase, writing only a .h file for our DataReader class and having made an empty file for a makefile. This week was spent mostly planning out our project, like making tweaks to some methods from the way they were listed in the proposal. Our group members have all had several midterms this week and are now a little behind on the project, but hopefully we can catch up over the break next week.

# Report 11-29

Thorough progress was made over the break. First we learned the basics of making a MakeFile, and created one that accomplishes the task for our project. The DataReader class has also been completed, so all the data in our board game CSV data file is able to be processed. Our graph class has also been started, so we can read nodes from our dataset and all the edges are stored in an weighted adjacency matrix. These graphs are also able to be stored in txt files, so they can be loaded and stored without having to go through the step of calculating all the edge weights, which would take O(n^2) time. Some helper methods have also been written, such as a method that gets all the neighbors of a specific node. A version of our BFS has also been completed, and it is currently able to traverse the entire graph. The version of the BFS specified in the proposal is able to filter by certain parameters as well, however this version of the BFS has yet to be completed. Our other two algorithms, nearest neighbor and betweenness centrality also have to be completed. 

# Report 12-6

Most of the progress that was made this week was making sure that everything we have done up to this points was clean. For example, we found multiple bugs our codebase that needed to be cleaned up. The first of these was a bug in the graph weighting, which was making weights large when they should've been made small. After this issue was resolved, another bug was found, which was with the reading/saving of graphs. On large graphs, there were null pointer exceptions, which had to do with how the graphs were being saved in a bad format. Once this was fixed, they were able to be saved/loaded at any size without any issue. We also added progress bars to our graph initialization, as this function usually takes a while and therefore it would be nice to have a progress indicator. Our next goals as a group are to complete Dijkstra's algorithm and a betweenness centrality algorithm. These should be completed by Friday, so the days after can be used finding any bugs/testing, while also working on our video. We will also start building out a testing suite this week. Much research has been done this week into possible betweenness centrality algorithms, mostly between Floyd-Warshall and Brandes' algorithm. We will have to decide the one that fits our data best and implement that. We are on track to finish our project according to the proposed timeline.
