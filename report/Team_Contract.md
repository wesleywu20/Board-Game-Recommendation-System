# CS 225 Final Project Team “soup” Contract (aspal2-iansong2-wwu70-ipendem2)

## Communication

-   Team Meetings: We will meet once every Tuesday through Discord from 8-9PM. We’ll check in to make sure everyone is on track and there aren’t any major roadblocks and adjust the timeline as needed. ipendem2 will take notes every meeting. Any redistribution of work will happen here as well.
    
-   Assistance: We will use the “soup” group chat on Discord to communicate with one another. A response within a couple hours is expected, barring being in an exam, class, etc. Every teammate, regardless of whether the issue directly affects them or not, should be aware of what is being discussed in the chat.
    
-   Respect: Since we are all friends, we have no issue being open with one another. However, sometimes people can hesitate to ask questions or call others out. We have decided that the best way to handle this is to simply say what you need to say. Since the success of this project depends on all of us, we should be open and honest with one another. In exchange, we promise not to judge others for questions or doubts they might have. We should empathize with one another, and all of our decisions and statements should be made with the best intentions for our group and project in mind.
    

## Collaboration

-   Work Distribution: There are some members of the team that work faster than others. While ideally we would love to have an even split, we may not be able to due to the deadline we have. We’ll separate the work based on our strengths and daily schedules. We will do our best to make it as equal as possible. Any unexpected complications will be brought up in the group chat, and we’ll decide what to do from there (dependant on how close to the deadline we are, how big the issue is, who we think can deal with the issue best, if we have to alter the project due to the issue, etc). The same applies to any unforeseen work coming up.
    
-   Time Commitment: We expect 4 to 5 hours per week from each member. This may increase or decrease depending on if work goes faster or slower than expected, including problems that could occur. If a minimum of 4 hours cannot be given due to other important due dates, events, or large amounts of homework, then that’s okay. But the work should be done according to the timeline, unless it’s a special case where we all agree postponing is fine.
    
-   Conflict Resolution: The number one thing is communication. As long as we’re honest and open with our progress/pitfalls, we should be okay. If there is a disagreement between two members that they cannot resolve themselves, then the team will come together to resolve the issue. If a member is not able to complete their tasks on time, then we will again come together to see what the issue is and how it can be resolved, such as a member overseeing the implementation of a specific task, redistributing work, etc. Tardiness is not a huge issue; if someone has something come up and is late multiple times they just have to make sure they’re caught up on everything that was discussed during the meeting. If there was something that they wanted to discuss or a bigger conversation that they had to be a part of, we will set up another meeting based on our availability and the urgency of the issue.
